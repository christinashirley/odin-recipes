    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe is like your favourite baked potato with all the fixins, like
      bacon, sour cream, green onion, and cheese, but in a bowl!
    </p>
    <p>Serves 6 people (1.5 cups each).</p>

    <ul>
      <li>4 oz. bacon</li>
      <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
      <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
      <li>2 lbs russet potatoes</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>4 oz cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
      <li>3 green onions, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add the bacon to a large soup pot and cook over medium heat until brown
        and crispy. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the bacon to a clean bowl or
        plate, leaving the bacon grease in the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the bacon is cooking, dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the
        onion and garlic to the pot after the bacon has been removed and cook
        over medium heat in the bacon grease until the onions are soft and
        translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the butter and flour to the pot and continue to stir and cook over
        medium heat for about two minutes to form a roux.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken broth and milk to the pot and whisk to dissolve all of
        the flour and butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the diced potatoes to the pot, cover, and turn the heat up to
        medium-high to bring the broth up to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat
        down to medium-low and let the potatoes simmer for 15 minutes, or until
        they are very tender (easily pierced with a fork).
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a potato masher or immersion blender to mash the potatoes until the
        soup is to your desired thickness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the soup with smoked paprika, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Once
        seasoned, stir in the sour cream.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the soup hot and top each bowl with the crumbled bacon, sliced
        green onions, and cheddar cheese.
      </li>
    </ol>
