    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This chicken stew is a rich and hearty mix of tender chicken thigs,
      vegetables, and a light but flavorful herb-infused gravy.
    </p>
    <p>Serves 6 people (1.5 cups each).</p>

    <ul>
      <li>1 yellow onion</li>
      <li>3 ribs celery</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1/2 lb carrots</li>
      <li>4 tbsp all-purpose flour, divided</li>
      <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
      <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>1.5 lbs baby potatoes</li>
      <li>1 tsp dried parsley</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp dried thyme</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp dried rosemary</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp dried sage</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>2 cups vegetable broth</li>
      <li>1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Dice the onion and celery, mince the garlic, slice the carrots, and cut
        the baby potatoes in half before you begin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the chicken thighs into 1-inch pieces. Sprinkle 2 Tbsp of the flour
        over the chicken and toss until the chicken is evenly coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the butter and olive oil to a large pot. Heat the butter and oil
        over medium until they are hot and sizzling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the flour-coated chicken to the pot with the butter and oil and
        allow the chicken to brown on all sides (avoid stirring until browned on
        the bottom). When the chicken is browned and there is a nice brown layer
        of flour on the bottom of the pot, remove the chicken to a clean bowl
        with a slotted spoon. The chicken does not need to be cooked through at
        this point, just browned on the outside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the onion, celery, garlic, and carrots to the pot and continue to
        sauté until the onions are soft. Use the moisture released by the
        vegetables to dissolve and scrape the browned bits off the bottom of the
        pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the vegetables are slightly softened, add the remaining 2 Tbsp
        flour to the pot and continue to sauté over medium for about two minutes
        more. The flour will begin to coat the bottom of the pot again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the browned chicken to the pot. Also add the potatoes, parsley,
        thyme, rosemary, sage, pepper, chicken broth, and vegetable broth. Stir
        to combine and dissolve any flour off the bottom of the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a lid on the pot and allow it to come up to a boil. Once it
        reaches a boil, remove the lid and turn the heat down to medium-low.
        Allow the stew to simmer over medium-low, without a lid and stirring
        occasionally, for about 30 minutes or until the potatoes are tender and
        the broth has thickened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste the stew and add salt if needed (I did not add any, but it will
        depend on the salt content of the broth you used). Add a tablespoon of
        fresh chopped parsley if desired, and serve hot.
      </li>
    </ol>
